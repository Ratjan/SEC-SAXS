# SEC-SAXS
Utilities for manipulating SEC-SAXS data

Make sure these libraries are installed:
os
sys
numpy
matplotlib
ipympl
pandas

To run, frames/shots in the format of .dat from CoSAXS should be in a folder labeled scan-xxxxx placed in the Data folder. (The placeholder.txt can be removed)
E.g. Data/scan-62739/shot_0001.dat

Otherwise, change the data directory as needed.
